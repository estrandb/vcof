Voltage Controlled Oscillator

Using a STM32F4_Discovery dev board. Requires a bunch of libs from CMSIS for the STM32F407V/G. 
Signal being generated, I can get a saw/sin/step and noise on the oscilliscope. Head currently
burried in DSP land to learn how to vary the frequency of the signal via ADC without modifying the DAC clock or the sample rate.

Planning on implementing a Voltage Controlled Filter as well.
